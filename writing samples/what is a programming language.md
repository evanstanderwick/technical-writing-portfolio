# What Is a Programming Language?

_Programming_ is a fancy word that simply means _telling a computer to do something_.

However, humans and computers don’t speak the same language. You and I think and talk in human language, sometimes called _natural language_. Computers, on the other hand, think and talk in _binary_, which is essentially _a series of ones and zeros_.

So, if you and your computer can’t understand each other, how do you tell your computer to do something for you? This is where programming languages come in.

Programming languages are _collections of words, phrases, and punctuation which both humans and computers can understand_.


## For example

Let’s look at an example of the programming language _Python_ in action:

1. Let’s say I want to tell my computer to say “Hello, world!” So in English, my command would be: "Say ‘Hello, world!’"
2. But my computer doesn’t speak English - my language. And I don’t speak binary - its language. However, we both speak Python. So, I’ll translate my command into Python and give it to my computer [using the Python program](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In Python, here’s what my command looks like: <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>
3. My computer will then take that command and break it down into the <strong>binary</strong> it understands so well. This act is called <em>compilation</em>.
4. Once my command has been fully translated from English into binary, my computer will read it and obediently say: <code>Hello, world!</code>

Over the years, people have invented hundreds of different programming languages. Each programming language has its own words, phrases, and punctuation, but all programming languages serve essentially the same purpose: <em>to translate human language into binary</em>. For example, here are a few of the world’s most popular programming languages, alongside their command to make a computer say ‘Hello, world!’:

* Python: <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>
* Java: <code>System.out.print("Hello, world!");</code>
* C: <code>printf("Hello, world!");</code>
* JavaScript: <code>console.log('Hello, world!');</code>
* C#: <code>Console.Write("Hello, world!");</code>


## Wrap up

To wrap up, here’s a few key points to remember about programming languages:

* A programming language is a _collection of words, phrases, and punctuation which both humans and computers can understand_.
* Programming languages enable people to give commands to computers by _translating human language into binary_.
* Computers take commands written in programming languages and then _compile_ those commands into binary before responding.
