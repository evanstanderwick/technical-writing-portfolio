Hi! My name is Evan Standerwick. Iâ€™m a data analyst based out of New York City, and this is my technical writing portfolio.

My portfolio contains a small collection of short documents which demonstrate my ability to explain technical concepts to a diverse range of audiences. You can find these documents under the [writing samples](https://github.com/evanstanderwick/technical-writing-portfolio/tree/main/writing%20samples) folder.

You can find a copy of my resume at [my_resume.pdf](my_resume.pdf).

To contact me, feel free to send me an email at evanstanderwick@gmail.com.
